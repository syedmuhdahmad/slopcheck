"""SLOP030: near-duplicate functions across the project.

Each function is normalized (docstring dropped, parameters and local variables
renamed by position) and turned into a token sequence. Identical sequences are
duplicates. For near-duplicates, each function gets a small MinHash sketch of its
token 4-grams; functions sharing at least ``MIN_SHARED`` sketch values are compared
with difflib and reported above ``SIMILARITY``. Functions with fewer than ``MIN_STATEMENTS``
statements are ignored: short helpers look alike by nature.

Measured on 122,000 functions from the stdlib and 225 packages, these are not
reported, because they are almost always deliberate:

* methods with the same name in different classes (plugins, drivers, platform
  variants: ``seek`` in two image formats);
* parallel families with the same structure and different values: every
  difference is a same-length substitution (``polyadd`` and ``polysub``,
  ``read_uint2`` and ``read_uint8``), or at most ``MIRROR_TOKENS`` tokens differ
  (``md5_utf8`` and ``sha_utf8``). A copy someone edited has insertions or
  deletions instead;
* functions with the same name in the same file (alternatives under ``if``/``try``);
* near-duplicate methods. Methods are only reported when identical; near-duplicates
  are reported for standalone functions, the helpers AI assistants re-create.

Even then, near-duplicates in established code are mostly deliberate twins
(``nanargmin``/``nanargmax``, ``getinnerframes``/``getouterframes``), so a full scan
reports identical copies only. With ``--diff``, functions you changed are also
checked for near-duplicates of existing code: that's when an assistant re-writes a
helper that already exists.
