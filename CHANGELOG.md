## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-03

Three new rules, private package support, and safer defaults for private code.

### Upgrade notes

- **Imports are no longer looked up on PyPI by default** ([#34](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/34)). Dependency files (`requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) are still checked as before. To also check imports in source code, as v0.1 did, pass `--check-imports` or set `check-imports = true` in `[tool.slopfence]`. See "What slopfence sends over the network" in the README.
- **If pip or uv uses a private index** (`PIP_INDEX_URL`, `pip.conf`, `uv.toml`…), `SLOP001` now makes no PyPI lookups, and the report says so in a note ([#17](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/17)). If that index only mirrors PyPI, set `detect-private-index = false`.
- Three new rules (`SLOP011`, `SLOP030`, `SLOP040`) are on by default. To roll them out gradually, use `ignore = ["SLOP030"]`, `--diff`, or `--fail-on medium` (SLOP040 is low severity).

### Added

- **New rules:**
  - `SLOP011` stub functions: a docstring that promises work ("Validate the token") over a body that returns hardcoded data or nothing ([#22](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/22))
  - `SLOP030` duplicate functions: identical functions across the project, ignoring names and docstrings. With `--diff`, changed functions are also reported when they're ≥90% similar to an existing one ([#11](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/11))
  - `SLOP040` swallowed exceptions: `except Exception: pass` and bare `except: pass` in application code (low severity) ([#21](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/21))
- **Private packages and indexes:**
  - `known-packages` config and `--known-packages` option: private packages that `SLOP001` accepts without a PyPI lookup, with glob support ([#15](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/15))
  - Private indexes in the environment are detected: `PIP_INDEX_URL` and the other pip and uv variables, `pip.conf` / `pip.ini`, `uv.toml`, and Pipfile sources. Then `SLOP001` makes no PyPI lookups. New `detect-private-index` config and `--detect-private-index` / `--no-detect-private-index` options ([#17](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/17))
  - Project-wide private indexes in `pyproject.toml` are detected (`[[tool.poetry.source]]`, `[[tool.uv.index]]`, `[tool.uv]` and `[tool.uv.pip]` `index-url` / `extra-index-url`, `[[tool.pdm.source]]`): that file's dependencies are neither reported nor sent to PyPI ([#34](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/34))
  - Index URLs are matched by host, never printed (they can contain credentials), and never treated as public just because they contain "pypi.org"
- **Better import checks:** `SLOP001` knows which package provides an import even when the names differ and the package isn't installed (`bs4` from `beautifulsoup4`, `google.cloud` from `google-cloud-storage`), and reads `uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `pdm.lock`, `Pipfile.lock` and `Pipfile` for indirect dependencies ([#16](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/16))
- **Options:**
  - `check-imports` config and `--check-imports` / `--no-check-imports` ([#34](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/34))
  - `fail-on` config and `--fail-on`: choose which severities fail the run ([#18](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/18))
  - `strict` config and `--strict` / `--no-strict`: unparseable Python files exit with code 2. Parse errors are also reported in SARIF as tool notifications, and JSON/SARIF use project-relative paths for them ([#19](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/19))
- **Reports:** notes, e.g. why `SLOP001` skipped lookups. Text output prints them, JSON has a `notes` list, and SARIF has `note` tool notifications
- **Docs:** demo GIF in the README, recorded with VHS from `docs/demo/demo.tape` ([#24](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/24)), plus the slopfence logo

### Changed

- **Privacy:** `SLOP001` no longer sends import names from your source code to PyPI by default (see the upgrade notes). The README and `SECURITY.md` explain exactly what is sent ([#34](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/34))
- The source distribution only contains the package, tests and the files needed to build it (about 40 KB instead of 410 KB) ([#35](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/35))
- Colour output: rule IDs are coloured by severity, locations are dimmed, and the summary counts are coloured. Plain output (`--no-color`, pipes, files) is unchanged

### Fixed

- `SLOP010` false positives from "for demo purposes" in human-written docs. It now needs "only" or placeholder wording nearby, and demo/example code is skipped ([#20](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/20))

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- GitHub Action: install into a private virtualenv instead of the runner's system Python, which recent runners reject (PEP 668), and pick a Python 3.10+ interpreter (`python3` or `python`, so it also works on Windows) ([#13](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/13))
- Crash on Windows when a finding quotes non-ASCII text such as an emoji: output is now always UTF-8. The crash exited with code 1, the same as "issues found" ([#13](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/13))
- PyPI version and Python badges on the PyPI page ([#9](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/pull/9))

### Added

- `[tool.slopfence]` configuration in `pyproject.toml` with `select`, `ignore` and `exclude` ([#10](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/10))
- `--exclude` option
- End-to-end CI tests for the GitHub Action (Linux, macOS, Windows, including SARIF upload to code scanning) and the pre-commit hook ([#13](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/13), [#14](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/14))

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Published to PyPI as `slopfence` (the project was originally named slopcheck, but that PyPI name belongs to an unrelated project)
- `slopfence` CLI with `--diff`, `--format text|json|sarif`, `--select`, `--ignore`, `--offline` and `--exit-zero`
- `SLOP001`: dependencies and imports that don't exist on PyPI, with a local cache
- `SLOP010`: placeholder comments left in finished-looking code
- `SLOP020`: tests that only assert on their own mocks
- `SLOP021`: tests whose only assertions are always true
- `SLOP022`: tests whose assertions are swallowed by try/except
- `SLOP051`: leftover AI chat text in comments and docstrings
- `# slopfence: ignore[...]` and `# slopfence: ignore-file` directives
- GitHub Action (`action.yml`) and pre-commit hook

### Project setup

- Project README describing the problem, design principles, planned detectors and roadmap
