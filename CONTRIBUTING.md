# Contributing to slopfence

Thanks for your interest in slopfence! This project is at an early stage, which is the best time to shape it. Every kind of contribution helps: code, detector ideas, real-world examples, docs, and bug reports.

By participating, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

New here? Look for issues labelled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [`help wanted`](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/labels/help%20wanted).

## Before you start coding

- **Small fixes** (typos, docs, obvious bugs): open a pull request directly.
- **Anything bigger** (new detectors, new features, behaviour changes): open an issue first and wait for a maintainer to agree on the approach. This avoids wasted work.
- Comment on an issue to say you're working on it, so others don't duplicate effort.

## Development workflow

`main` is protected: **nobody pushes to it directly**, maintainers included. All changes go through pull requests.

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork.
2. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name:
   - `feat/slop001-pypi-lookup`
   - `fix/false-positive-mock-assert`
   - `docs/contributing-typo`
3. **Make your changes.** Keep each pull request focused on one thing.
4. **Add tests** for any behaviour change. Detectors need both:
   - cases that **should** be flagged, and
   - similar-looking cases that **should not** be flagged (false-positive guards).
5. **Run checks locally** (see below) and make sure they pass.
6. **Push** to your fork and **open a pull request** against `main`. Fill in the template.

### What happens to your pull request

- The `ci` check must pass. It only passes when all of these pass: lint, tests on Linux, macOS and Windows, the package build (the same build and smoke test as a release), the end-to-end tests of the GitHub Action and the pre-commit hook, and test coverage (line and branch coverage, combined over every Python version and OS, must stay at or above `fail_under` in `pyproject.toml`; the run summary shows a per-file table).
- **CodeRabbit reviews every pull request** automatically and again after each push, and its findings must be fixed before merging. The required `CodeRabbit` check makes sure it has finished reviewing. It requests changes while it has open comments or a failing pre-merge check (a clear title, the linked issue fully addressed, and docstrings on at least 80% of the functions you touch), and approves once they are resolved. If you think a finding is wrong, reply to it: CodeRabbit answers, and a maintainer decides.
- A maintainer merges it once the checks pass and review comments are addressed.
- All review conversations must be resolved.
- Pull requests are **squash-merged**, so `main` has a clean, linear history with one commit per pull request. The pull request title becomes the commit message, so make it clear.
- Your branch is deleted automatically after merge.

## Local checks

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'

pytest                           # tests
coverage run -m pytest && coverage combine && coverage report   # coverage
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
slopfence src tests              # slopfence must pass on its own code
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "!.venv/**"
```

If you change `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`, also run the end-to-end hook test (needs `pip install pre-commit`):

```bash
.github/scripts/test-pre-commit-hook.sh .
```

### Re-recording the demo GIF

`docs/demo.gif` is generated from `docs/demo/demo.tape` with [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs). To re-record it after changing the output, run this (needs Docker):

```bash
docs/demo/record.sh
```

The demo project is created at record time by `docs/demo/make-project.sh`, so no sloppy files live in the repo.

### Adding a detector

1. Add the rule to `RULES` in `src/slopfence/models.py`.
2. Write the detector in `src/slopfence/detectors/` and register it in `detectors/__init__.py`.
3. Add tests with **both** flagged and not-flagged cases. Real-world code that must stay quiet is the most valuable test.
4. Run it against a large codebase (for example your Python install's standard library) and check for false positives before opening the pull request.

## Commit and pull request style

- Use the imperative mood: "Add PyPI lookup cache", not "Added" or "Adds".
- Pull request titles follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style where it fits:
  - `feat: add SLOP010 placeholder comment detector`
  - `fix: ignore mocks used as fixtures in SLOP020`
  - `docs: clarify ignore comment syntax`
  - `chore: bump actions/checkout`
- Reference related issues: `Closes #12`.

## Writing a good detector

A detector is only useful if people trust it. Before proposing or writing one, check:

1. **Is it objective?** Could two reviewers agree on whether a given snippet matches?
2. **Is it high-confidence?** It's better to miss some cases than to flag correct code.
3. **Is it actionable?** The message should tell the user what's wrong and how to fix it.
4. **Is it about the pattern, not the author?** slopfence never tries to guess whether AI wrote the code.
