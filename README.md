**A fast, deterministic quality gate for AI-assisted code.**

slopfence finds the junk that AI coding assistants leave behind (hallucinated packages, tests that test nothing, placeholder stubs, duplicate helpers, swallowed errors and leftover chat text) before it gets merged.

![slopfence checking an AI-written billing service: it finds a dependency that doesn't exist on PyPI, a placeholder comment, leftover "Certainly!" chat text, and three tests that can't fail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/main/docs/demo.gif)

> 🚧 **Status: alpha (v0.1, Python only).** The first detectors work and are tested against 20,000+ files of real-world code for false positives. Expect rough edges. Feedback is very welcome. See [Contributing](#contributing).

---

## Quick start

```bash
pip install slopfence
```

Or run it without installing, using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/):

```bash
uvx slopfence .
pipx run slopfence .
```

Check a project:

```bash
slopfence .
```

Check only what your branch changed (ideal for pull requests):

```bash
slopfence --diff main
```

### Options

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--diff REF` | Only report issues on lines changed since `REF` (plus new untracked files) |
| `--format text\|json\|sarif` | Output format. SARIF shows findings inline on GitHub pull requests |
| `-o, --output FILE` | Write the report to a file |
| `--offline` | Make no network requests (disables `SLOP001`) |
| `--check-imports` / `--no-check-imports` | Also look up unknown imports in your source code on PyPI. Off by default, because it sends those names to pypi.org (see [What slopfence sends over the network](#what-slopfence-sends-over-the-network)) |
| `--select` / `--ignore` | Comma-separated rule IDs to run or skip, e.g. `--ignore SLOP051` |
| `--exclude` | Comma-separated paths or globs to skip, e.g. `--exclude migrations,*_pb2.py` |
| `--known-packages` | Comma-separated private package names or globs that `SLOP001` must accept, e.g. `--known-packages corp-*` |
| `--detect-private-index` / `--no-detect-private-index` | Skip PyPI lookups when pip or uv is set up with a private index (on by default). Turn it off if that index only mirrors PyPI. See [Private package indexes](#private-package-indexes) |
| `--fail-on high\|medium\|low` | Lowest severity that fails the run (default `low`: any issue). All issues are still reported |
| `--strict` / `--no-strict` | Exit `2` if any Python file can't be parsed (by default it's skipped with a warning) |
| `--exit-zero` | Always exit 0 (report only) |
| `--list-rules` | Show all rules |

Exit codes: `0` no issues (or none at or above `--fail-on`), `1` issues found, `2` error (bad options or config, or unparseable files with `--strict`).

Run slopfence with a Python at least as new as the syntax your code uses; otherwise newer syntax can't be parsed.

### Configuration

Add a `[tool.slopfence]` table to the `pyproject.toml` at your project root:

```toml
[tool.slopfence]
select = ["SLOP001", "SLOP010", "SLOP020"]  # rules to run (default: all)
ignore = ["SLOP051"]                         # rules to skip
exclude = ["migrations", "tests/fixtures/", "*_pb2.py"]
known-packages = ["corp-auth", "corp-*"]    # private packages that aren't on PyPI
check-imports = false                        # true also looks up imports on PyPI (default: false)
detect-private-index = true                  # false if your private index only mirrors PyPI
fail-on = "high"                             # only high-severity issues fail the run
strict = true                                # unparseable files are an error
```

`exclude` works like `.gitignore`: a pattern without a `/` in the middle matches any file or folder name anywhere (`migrations`, `*_pb2.py`), and a pattern with one is relative to the project root (`tests/fixtures/`). Excluded files are never checked, but imports of excluded modules still count as your own code.

Command-line options (`--select`, `--ignore`, `--exclude`, `--known-packages`, `--check-imports`, `--detect-private-index`, `--fail-on`, `--strict`) replace the matching config values. Unknown keys and rule IDs are reported as errors (exit code `2`).

### Ignoring a finding

```python
# In a real implementation, use the cache.  # slopfence: ignore[SLOP010]
x = legacy()  # slopfence: ignore
```

Put `# slopfence: ignore-file` anywhere in a file to skip it. In `requirements.txt`, add `# slopfence: ignore` to a line.

**Private packages:** if your project uses internal packages that aren't on PyPI, list them once in `known-packages` instead of adding ignore comments everywhere. Names are matched case-insensitively with `-`, `_` and `.` treated alike (so `corp_auth` matches `corp-auth`), and `*` globs work. Known packages are never looked up on PyPI, and imports of them are never flagged.

`SLOP010` (placeholders) also skips test code and demo or example code: files under `demo/`, `examples/` or `samples/` folders, or named like `demo.py` or `auth_example.py`.

### What slopfence sends over the network

slopfence only talks to one server, `https://pypi.org`, and only for `SLOP001`. It sends a request per package name (`HEAD https://pypi.org/pypi/<name>/json`) and nothing else: no code, no file names, no telemetry.

| Names sent to PyPI | When |
|---|---|
| Dependencies declared in `requirements*.txt` and `pyproject.toml` | By default. These names are already meant for a package index. Entries installed from URLs, paths or git are never sent. Neither is any dependency in a file that uses a private index: `--index-url` / `--extra-index-url` in a requirements file, a `[[tool.poetry.source]]` or `[[tool.uv.index]]` that isn't PyPI (unless it's `explicit`, which only affects the dependencies that name it), or a per-dependency Poetry `source` or `[tool.uv.sources]` entry |
| Imports in your source code that aren't stdlib, installed, part of your project, or provided by a declared or locked package | **Only with `--check-imports`** (or `check-imports = true`). This can catch an invented package that was imported but never declared, but for private code it may reveal internal package names |

Names in `known-packages` are never sent. Answers are cached for a day (missing) or a week (found) in `~/.cache/slopfence`, so repeated runs send fewer requests. `--offline` sends nothing at all.

### Private package indexes

If your packages may come from an index other than PyPI, a name that PyPI doesn't know could be a private package. slopfence then doesn't report it and doesn't send it to PyPI. It looks for private indexes in:

| Where | What counts as private |
|---|---|
| `requirements*.txt` | `-i` / `--index-url` / `--extra-index-url` with a non-PyPI URL: that file's packages |
| `pyproject.toml` | `[[tool.poetry.source]]` (except `explicit` ones), `[[tool.uv.index]]` (except `explicit` ones), `[tool.uv] index-url` / `extra-index-url` (also under `[tool.uv.pip]`), `[[tool.pdm.source]]`: that file's packages. A per-dependency Poetry `source` or `[tool.uv.sources]` entry: that package |
| `Pipfile`, `Pipfile.lock` | A `[[source]]` that isn't PyPI |
| Environment variables | `PIP_INDEX_URL`, `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`, `UV_INDEX`, `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX`, `UV_INDEX_URL`, `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` |
| pip configuration | `pip.conf` / `pip.ini` in pip's global, user and virtualenv locations, and `PIP_CONFIG_FILE` (`[global]` and `[install]` sections) |
| uv configuration | `uv.toml` in the project, user and system config folders, or `UV_CONFIG_FILE` (`UV_NO_CONFIG` turns this off), including its `[pip]` table used by `uv pip install` |

A private index in a project file stops lookups for that file's dependencies, and for imports with `--check-imports`. A private index in your **environment** (variables, pip or uv configuration) could serve any package, so `SLOP001` makes **no lookups at all** and the report says so in a note. An index is public only if its host is `pypi.org` or `pythonhosted.org`. slopfence never prints index URLs, because they can contain credentials.

If your company index only **mirrors** PyPI, set `detect-private-index = false` (or pass `--no-detect-private-index`) to check packages against PyPI again, and list your own private packages in `known-packages`.

### Imports with a different package name

With `--check-imports`, an import isn't looked up when a declared dependency or a locked package provides it, even if the names differ and the package isn't installed where slopfence runs. For example, `import bs4` is covered by `beautifulsoup4`, `import dateutil` by `python-dateutil`, and `from google.cloud import storage` by `google-cloud-storage`. slopfence reads `uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `pdm.lock`, `Pipfile.lock` and `Pipfile`, so indirect dependencies count too (`import idna` when only `requests` is declared).

### What the code-quality rules skip

To keep false positives low, the newer rules are deliberately conservative:

- **`SLOP011` stub functions** needs a docstring that promises work (it starts with a verb like *validate*, *fetch*, *send*, *calculate*) or admits it isn't done (*placeholder*, *TODO*, *for now*). The body must then return hardcoded data while ignoring every input, or return nothing although the return type promises a value. Abstract methods, `@overload`, properties, `Protocol`/ABC classes, `if TYPE_CHECKING:` blocks, documented hooks ("override this", "does nothing by default") and tests are skipped.
- **`SLOP030` duplicate functions** ignores functions with fewer than 3 statements and test code. Parameter and variable names and docstrings don't matter; called functions, attributes and constants do. A full scan reports **identical** copies (every copy except the first). With `--diff`, functions you changed are also compared with the rest of the project and reported when they're **≥90% similar** to an existing function, because that's when an assistant re-writes a helper that already exists. Never reported: methods with the same name in different classes (plugins, drivers), functions defined twice in one file (under `if`/`try`), near-duplicate methods, and parallel families that differ only by swapped names, operators or constants (`md5_utf8`/`sha_utf8`, `polyadd`/`polysub`).
- **`SLOP040` swallowed exceptions** only flags `except Exception`, `except BaseException` and bare `except:` whose body is just `pass` or `...`. A comment in the handler (`# best effort`), cleanup code (`__del__`, `__exit__`, `close()`, `atexit` handlers, `try: os.unlink(...)`), `contextlib.suppress`, tests and examples are skipped.

### GitHub Action

```yaml
# .github/workflows/slopfence.yml
name: slopfence
on: pull_request
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  slopfence:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: syedmuhdahmad/slopfence@v0.1.1
```

On pull requests it automatically checks only the changed lines (set `diff: none` to check everything, or `diff: <ref>` for a specific ref). To show findings inline on the pull request, set `sarif-file: slopfence.sarif` and upload it with `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` (needs `security-events: write`).

### pre-commit

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence
    rev: v0.1.1
    hooks:
      - id: slopfence
```

## The problem

AI coding tools (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Codex and others) are now part of everyday development. They write code fast, and that code usually *looks* correct. It compiles, it's well formatted, and it has comments and tests.

But it often comes with recognizable junk:

- **Packages that don't exist.** The AI imports `flask-jwt-simple-auth` because the name sounds plausible. Attackers now register these invented names to spread malware, a technique known as **slopsquatting**.
- **Tests that test nothing.** A test creates a mock, sets a value on it, then asserts that value. It passes forever and protects nothing.
- **Placeholder code shipped as real code.** Comments like `# In a real implementation, validate the token` above a function that returns `True`.
- **Duplicate helpers.** `format_date()`, `formatDate()` and `date_formatter()` in three different files, because the AI wrote a new helper instead of finding the existing one.
- **Over-defensive code.** `try/except Exception: pass` around code that can't fail, which hides real errors.
- **Comment noise.** `# Increment counter by 1` above `counter += 1`, or leftover chat text like *"Here's the updated function:"*.

Reviewers miss these because the code *looks* fine. Each one is small. Together they add up to security holes, false confidence from green test suites, and codebases that get harder to maintain every sprint.

## Why existing tools aren't enough

| Tool | What it's good at | What it misses |
|---|---|---|
| **Ruff, ESLint, Pylint** | Style and common bugs | AI-specific patterns, invented packages |
| **Vulture, Knip** | Dead code | Fake tests, placeholders, near-duplicates |
| **jscpd** | Copy-pasted code | Code that's similar but not identical |
| **Socket, Snyk** | Supply-chain security | Code-quality patterns; mostly paid |
| **[slopcheck](https://github.com/0xToxSec/slopcheck)** (unrelated project) | Checking for hallucinated packages before you install them | Code-quality patterns such as fake tests, placeholders and chat leftovers |
| **AI code reviewers** (e.g. Claude `/code-review`) | Deep, context-aware review | Not deterministic, costs tokens, doesn't automatically check package registries, runs only when someone asks |

No single tool focuses on **the failure modes of AI-written code**, built for reviewing pull requests. That's the gap slopfence fills.

### slopfence vs. AI reviewers: complementary, not competing

```text
Developer + AI writes code
        │
        ▼
slopfence            ← fast, free, same result every time; runs on every commit
        │
        ▼
AI / LLM review      ← deep reasoning about logic and design
        │
        ▼
Human review
```

AI reviewers are smart but nondeterministic and cost money on every run. slopfence catches the objective, repeatable problems in seconds with no API keys, so reviewers (human or AI) can spend their attention on what matters.

## Who needs it

- **Teams adopting AI coding tools** that want a safety net without banning the tools.
- **Open-source maintainers** reviewing a growing number of AI-generated pull requests.
- **Security teams** worried about hallucinated or slopsquatted dependencies.
- **Tech leads** who want an objective quality gate instead of arguing over style in review.
- **Solo developers** who want to catch their AI assistant's mistakes before they commit.

## Design principles

1. **Detect patterns, not authorship.** slopfence never tries to guess *whether AI wrote the code*. That's unreliable and leads to arguments. It flags low-quality patterns that AI commonly produces, no matter who wrote them.
2. **Deterministic by default.** Rule-based checks with no LLM required. The same input always gives the same output.
3. **Diff-first.** Check only what changed in a pull request. Nobody wants 4,000 warnings on an old codebase.
4. **Low false positives over high recall.** A noisy linter gets uninstalled. Start strict, flag only obvious cases, and make everything configurable.
5. **Fits existing workflows.** CLI, pre-commit hook, GitHub Action, and SARIF output for GitHub code scanning.

## Detectors

| ID | Detector | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SLOP001` | Dependency (or, with `--check-imports`, import) of a package that doesn't exist on PyPI | 🔴 High | ✅ v0.1 (Python) |
| `SLOP002` | Dependency that is very new or has suspiciously few downloads (slopsquatting risk) | 🔴 High | Planned |
| `SLOP010` | Placeholder / stub comment (`In a real implementation…`, `Simplified for demo`) | 🟠 Medium | ✅ v0.1 |
| `SLOP011` | Function whose docstring promises work ("Validate the token") but which only returns hardcoded data or nothing | 🟠 Medium | ✅ v0.2 |
| `SLOP020` | Test that only asserts on its own mocks | 🔴 High | ✅ v0.1 |
| `SLOP021` | Test with no meaningful assertion (e.g. only `assert True`) | 🟠 Medium | ✅ v0.1 |
| `SLOP022` | Test wrapped in `try/except` so it can never fail | 🔴 High | ✅ v0.1 |
| `SLOP030` | Function identical to another one in the project (names and docstrings ignored); with `--diff`, also new functions ≥90% similar to existing ones | 🟠 Medium | ✅ v0.2 |
| `SLOP040` | `except Exception` (or bare `except`) that silently swallows every error | 🟡 Low | ✅ v0.2 |
| `SLOP050` | Comment that only restates the code | 🟡 Low | Planned for v0.2 ([#23](https://github.com/syedmuhdahmad/slopfence/issues/23)) |
| `SLOP051` | Leftover chat text in code (`Certainly! Here's…`) | 🟠 Medium | ✅ v0.1 |

## Example output

```

- **Parser:** v0.1 uses Python's built-in `ast` and `tokenize` (no dependencies). **tree-sitter** is planned so new languages can be added without rewriting the detectors.
- **Registry lookups** are cached locally (`~/.cache/slopfence`) to stay fast and avoid rate limits. If PyPI can't be reached, nothing is flagged: an unknown answer is never treated as "missing". Import names are only sent with `--check-imports` (see [What slopfence sends over the network](#what-slopfence-sends-over-the-network)).
- **Optional LLM mode** (planned, not built yet) would send only the unclear cases for a second opinion. Never required.

## Challenges (and how we plan to handle them)

| Challenge | Why it's hard | Plan |
|---|---|---|
| **False positives** | Every noisy warning erodes trust; one bad week and teams disable the tool. | Conservative rules, severity levels, `# slopfence: ignore[SLOP0xx]` comments, and a test corpus of real-world false positives. |
| **Private / internal packages** | Internal packages look identical to hallucinated ones. | Allowlists, private registry support, and reading local lockfiles and workspace packages. |
| **Registry rate limits** | Checking every import against PyPI/npm on every run is slow and gets throttled. | Local cache with TTL, batch lookups, offline mode. |
| **"Is this really junk?"** | Some patterns (defensive code, stubs) are legitimate in context. | Flag only high-confidence cases by default; stricter checks are opt-in. |
| **Near-duplicate detection at scale** | Comparing every function with every other is expensive. | AST normalization + hashing, and only comparing changed functions against the index. |
| **Multi-language support** | Each language has different idioms and test frameworks. | Start with Python only, do it well, then JS/TS via tree-sitter. |
| **Tone and adoption** | A tool that "shames AI users" will be resisted. | Position it as a quality gate *for* AI-assisted development, not against it. |
| **Moving target** | AI tools improve and their failure modes change. | Rules are data-driven and easy to add; community-contributed detectors. |
